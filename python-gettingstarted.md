# Getting Started with Python

## Installation
### Anaconda Python (Individual Edition)
**Recommended.**  This version includes many packages and dependencies you'll find useful.
* [Download Anaconda Python, Individual Edition](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads)
    * Pick a Python 3.7 version that matches your Operating System (Windows, Mac, Linux).
    * I typically use 64-bit installers.  If you have a very old computer (5+ years) you might want the 32-bit edition.
* Run the installer.  
    * *The instructions below are for a standard Windows install. [Other installation instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)* 
    1. Select to install for "Just Me".  
    2. Pick an installion directory.  The default is fine.
    3. Select "Register Anaconda3 as my default Python 3.7"
        * Note: if you have other verions of Python running, you will want to select the alternative option
    4. Select "Install".
    5. Once the installer is finished, you can select "Finish"

### Python
This version is only Python.  You will need to individually install additional packages.  
* [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Getting Started with Anaconda3
In your start menu, you should now have an option for Anaconda3.  
Anaconda Navigator is a good place to see all the programs you have installed that work with Anaconda3.  The Navigator also has a compiled list of official resources and help forums that you can visit for guidance.
### Start Programming
* Use iPython (Interactive Python)
* Use a text editor, then run your program
    * Most commonly you will use an IDE such as Visual Studio Code or PyCharm.
